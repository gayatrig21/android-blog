    <p>Android is an operating system that is built basically for Mobile phones. It is based on the Linux Kernel and other open-source software and is developed by Google. It is used for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. But nowadays these are used in Android Auto cars, TV, watches, camera, etc. It has been one of the best-selling OS for smartphones. Android OS was developed by Android Inc. which Google bought in 2005. Various applications (apps) like games, music player, camera, etc. are built for these smartphones for running on Android. Google Play store features more than 3.3 million apps. The app is developed on an application known as Android Studio. These executable apps are installed through a bundle or package called APK(Android Package Kit).</p>

   <b> Android Programming Languages<br></b>
In Android, basically, programming is done in two languages JAVA or C++ and XML(Extension Markup Language). Nowadays KOTLIN is also preferred. The XML file deals with the design, presentation, layouts, blueprint, etc (as a front-end) while the JAVA or KOTLIN deals with the working of buttons, variables, storing, etc (as a back-end).</p>

The App components are the building blocks of Android. Each component has its own role and life cycles i.e from launching of an app till the end. Some of these components depend upon others also. Each component has a definite purpose. <br>
<b>The four major app components are: </b>
<br>
Activities<br>
Services<br>
Broadcast Receivers<br>
Content Provider<br>
<b>Activities:</b> It deals with the UI and the user interactions to the screen. In other words, it is a User Interface that contains activities. These can be one or more depending upon the App. It starts when the application is launched. At least one activity is always present which is known as MainActivity. 
</p>
<p><b>Services:</b> Services are the background actions performed by the app, these might be long-running operations like a user playing music while surfing the Internet. A service might need other sub-services so as to perform specific tasks. The main purpose of the Services is to provide non-stop working of the app without breaking any interaction with the user. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Broadcast Receivers: </b> Broadcast is used to respond to messages from other applications or from the System. For example, when the battery of the phone is low, then the Android OS fires a Broadcasting message to launch the Battery Saver function or app, after receiving the message the appropriate action is taken by the app. Broadcast Receiver is the subclass of BroadcastReceiver class and each object is represented by Intent objects. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Content Provider:</b> Content Provider is used to transferring the data from one application to the others at the request of the other application. These are handled by the class ContentResolver class. This class implements a set of APIs(Application Programming Interface) that enables the other applications to perform the transactions. Any Content Provider must implement the Parent Class of ContentProvider class.
